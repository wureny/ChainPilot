# ChainPilot

## Background

ChainPilot is a cutting-edge AI-powered platform designed to help users navigate the complex world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto asset management. By integrating AI agents with blockchain technology, ChainPilot enables users to automatically generate optimized trading strategies, including DeFi mining and quantitative strategies, and execute them with precision. The platform aims to empower both novice and expert users to make informed decisions in the fast-paced crypto market.

## Motivation

AI and Web3 are both the current trend of the times. AI improves production efficiency, while Web3 changes production relations;

Today, almost everyone is using general-purpose AI products such as ChatGPT or DeepSeek, while AI agent is a better solution for AI to act in vertical fields and achieve professional-level automated operations; at the same time, many people have cryptocurrency assets and are eager for automatic and intelligent AI agents to help their on-chain assets get better returns;

In fact, in addition to the automatic and intelligent features, AI agent can also provide a simple interaction layer for Web3 users, hiding the complexity of specific implementation through abstract capabilities, which will greatly improve the convenience and experience of users;

In short, whether it is a novice or a degen, they can better use their on-chain assets through AI agent, which will greatly improve the user's capital efficiency and become a game changer;

Most of the current similar products are either too complex in interaction or lack a reliable security strategy, so most of them cannot really run on a large scale;

So, we launched ChainPilot: This is a product that can make AI Agent clusters (using workflow ideas, professional knowledge layers, security isolation and other technologies) help people achieve more convenient, smarter and more automatic on-chain trading products

In the traditional securities market, people trade with exchanges through brokers and manage assets through funds;

In the future AI+crypto world, all of this can be achieved through AI agents;
We believe that ChainPilot will become a professional and popular “on-chain broker & asset management firm”
